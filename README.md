# WebGPU compute demo
Demo of WebGPU compute with the standard marching cubes algorithm.

This was really just an experiment to see how easy it would be to execute a compute operation and use the output of that compute operation as the input to a rendering pipeline.

## Perfection?
No...this was just me reading the spec and trying to figure out how to do compute much like I did with the original sample I wrote ;)

## Requirements
Safari with the WebGPU experimental feature turned on.
